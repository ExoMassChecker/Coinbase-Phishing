- ✅ Security awareness training
- ✅ Educational purposes in cybersecurity courses
- ✅ Research into phishing detection methods
- ✅ Penetration testing with explicit authorization

**Prohibited Uses:**
- ❌ Actual phishing attacks
- ❌ Unauthorized testing
- ❌ Any malicious activities
- ❌ Training others for illegal purposes

## 🔬 Technical Analysis

### Attack Vector Demonstration:
1. **Initial Contact**: Social engineering via phone/email
2. **Urgency Creation**: False security alerts and account threats
3. **Credential Collection**: Multi-step authentication bypass
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Live victim interaction and data theft
5. **Persistence**: Multiple verification attempts and social pressure

### Evasion Techniques Shown:
- User-agent based content differentiation
- Legitimate content cloaking for security scanners
- Dynamic content assembly to avoid static detection
- HTTP header manipulation for authenticity
- Behavioral analysis to identify automated tools
