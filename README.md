## 🎓 **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE STATEMENT**

- **Please leave a star if you want more updates, for assistance/feature requests message @highnotes on discord**
  
> **📚 THIS IS A CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION TOOL** - Designed to demonstrate how phishing attacks work so people can learn to defend against them.

> **⚠️ EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY** - This platform is exclusively for cybersecurity education, training courses, and demonstrating attack techniques in safe, controlled learning environments.

> **🛡️ DEFENSIVE MISSION** - Created to help people understand phishing threats and improve their ability to recognize and avoid such attacks.

### **🎯 Why This Educational Tool Was Created**

**📈 The Problem**: I observed that sophisticated phishing attacks targeting cryptocurrency platforms like Coinbase were becoming increasingly common and successful. Many people were falling victim to these attacks because they didn't understand how convincing and sophisticated modern phishing attempts have become.

**🛡️ The Solution**: Rather than letting these attack techniques remain hidden, I created this educational platform to expose exactly how these attacks work. By understanding the attacker's methods, people and organizations can build better defenses.

This educational platform helps:

- **👨‍🏫 Educators** demonstrate real attack techniques in classroom settings
- **🏢 Companies** understand threats and build stronger defenses against phishing
- **👥 Organizations** train employees to recognize sophisticated phishing attempts  
- **🎓 Students** learn about modern cybersecurity threats through hands-on experience
- **🔬 Security Researchers** study attack patterns to develop better protective measures
- **🛡️ Security Professionals** understand attacker methodologies to strengthen defenses

**💡 Core Belief**: The best defense against phishing is education. When people understand exactly how these attacks work, they become much harder to fool.

**This tool shows HOW attacks work so people can learn to STOP them.**

An educational phishing simulation platform that recreates a Coinbase-like interface to demonstrate how sophisticated phishing attacks operate. This tool helps security professionals, educators, and organizations understand phishing methodologies, train employees on threat recognition, and improve overall cybersecurity awareness through hands-on learning.
